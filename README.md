*This one is still in-progress but I want you to be able to follow along so I've added some screenshots from the UI design phase.*

 I partnered with [Zac Rogers](https://github.com/ZacRogersWorks) to put this design together. Zac is a talented UX/UI designer who ran user interviews, created cards, built profiles and brought intentionality to each of the UI/UX decisions. We both riffed on designs and in the end we landed on this one that I put together:

## Implementation Outlook
The implementation of this project will be done using Tailwind CSS with a focus on browser compatibility, user accessibility and a reusable design system that can be expanded throughout the SaaS product. We wonâ€™t be implementing any frontend framework directly in this repo, the code will be handed off to the Sound Splits team for final implementation into the broader web app.

### Stay Tuned
We're just getting started on the implementation of this design, stay tuned here as more code get's pushed to the repo.
